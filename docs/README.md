# Rebyt — Intent Payments Verified by ZK Proofs and AI Consensus DEMO

This project demonstrates an intent-based payment flow on BNB Smart Chain with programmable settlement conditions.

Users sign a payment intent offchain.  
Funds are locked in escrow onchain.  
Settlement executes only after conditions are evaluated via GenLayer.

An optional ZK path verifies that the intent data matches the committed hash before funding.

---

## What this demo shows

- EIP-712 intent signing (offchain)
- Escrow funding on BSC Testnet
- ZK proof verification (Groth16)
- Conditional validation using GenLayer (Bradbury)
- Settlement execution (release / refund)

---

## Architecture

Intent → Escrow → Validation → Settlement  
    ↘ ZK verification

---

## How it works

1. User signs a PaymentIntent using EIP-712 typed data  
2. Solver submits a funding transaction to the escrow contract  
3. (Optional) A ZK proof verifies that the intent data matches the committed hash  
4. GenLayer validators evaluate the settlement condition  
5. Escrow releases or refunds funds based on the result

## ZK Proof System

The Solver generates a zero-knowledge proof that the intent data matches the committed hash before the escrow accepts funds.

- Circuit: Poseidon(recipient, amount, nonce) == intentHash  
- Proof system: Groth16  
- Verified onchain via: RebytEscrow.fundWithZK()

Example transaction (ZKProofVerified event):  
https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x1bce644f6ac296bbd5a75ffa0b783987d8648355bb4dd912d6cbe8970995ab3e

## Demo Flow

Frontend: one-page demo interface

Flow:
- Sign intent (EIP-712)
- Fund escrow (BSC Testnet)
- Observe validation (GenLayer Bradbury)
- Execute settlement (release / refund)

All steps are observable via onchain transactions and explorer links.

## Notes

- Escrow enforces fund custody onchain  
- ZK proof ensures intent data integrity before funding  
- Validation is externalized via GenLayer consensus  
- System remains functional even if validation is asynchronous
